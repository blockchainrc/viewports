  In order to maintain this extension, I would set license for this extension on Ethernet.
  The license smart contract address is : 0xCd5A3b7111b77D0E05c5860f83e19Dd99eA83e10

  Tip: without license would not effect any function on this extension, but it is great support for the developer.

  There are three methods to get license:

  1. buy on Ethernet(you could create account/ transaction by inner function of this extension, not indepent on metamask wallet)

  2. promote this extension to other, and contact admin on IRC for free license
  (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/viewport)

  3. donation to developer(0x0a1d3effa44dd3d145e6705ed9953bd6f07539c3) also would get free license
